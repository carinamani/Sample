I have included 2 examples of code 

  IO_calculations 
    
    Generates supply chain impact (spending) estimates for specified country-industries using a dummy leontif inverse matrix and technology matrix.

    Inputs = all input files required for the calculations

    Outputs = output CSV's for each country-industry with the spending impact of its 1st tier, 2nd tier, and 3rd+ tier supply  chain

    frontend.py = script to input country-industries and generate results 

    f_Calculate_IO_impacts.py = script with function for calculating supply chain impacts

crop_production 

    Imports data on the area used for global maize production, overlays a shapefile of US counties, and produces a map showing where land use for maize production is most     concentrated in the US. 
    
    Inputs = all input files required 

    maize_production.py = main script

    maize_production_map.jpg = output map
